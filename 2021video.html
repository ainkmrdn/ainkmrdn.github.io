            Imran Bard to the TikTok platform caught the attention of many.

          <p>A disable chinese man who is bareablely friendly and loves to entertain others became viral
           when he asked an iconic sentence which was "Hi awak, aku ganggu aa?". This sentence might me 
           simple and plain but for this humble man, it has brought him to be known by the whole 
           Malaysians with viewer of almost few millions on tiktok. He seems like a down-earthy man with

    <h3> 
        <font color = black>
            <p>It was heartwarming when the Prime Minister (PM), Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin joked to the people through his 
            speech during the SME Caring Package Special Message (additional) yesterday.
            Through a video posted on Facebook by Salsabty HQ, the then PM mentioned about some of the behavior of his 
            people during the implementation of the Movement Control Order (PKP)
            “I know, some husbands wear their wives' bat shirts. Some people ride bicycles inside the house, ”he said.
            However, it was most entertaining for netizens when the video also showed the behavior of a man dancing like 
            rappers after the PM joked about an individual who changed his speech into a rap song.
            "Some even changed my speech into a rap song. I hope this is not a strange occurrence, or throw away the habit 
            of saying people."This is part of your activities to get rid of the boredom of sitting at home," he added.
            Netizens described the PM as sensitive to the behavior of Malaysians who are contagious while at home.</p>

            <p>Ching chong eyes!" That's what elementary school kids used to call Sophie Wang. It was an insidious racist slur casually thrown around as they mocked her Asian ethnicity while pulling on the corner of their eyes. Upward for Japanese. To the side for Chinese. Downward for Korean.
                Wang is now 17 and many years removed from the days when her Asian American identity was reduced to "a single facial feature." And yet, scrolling through social media posts in recent months has brought those memories flooding back thanks to a new beauty trend: "fox eyes."
                On Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, people from all over the world have been posting videos  modeling the look -- using makeup and other tactics to emulate the lifted, so-called "almond-shaped" eyes of celebrities such as Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Megan Fox </p>

        <p>Through a share by Nur Shazwani Damia on her Twitter account, her men were sitting
        on the kitchen table while her face and hands were full of flour. Unexpectedly, the
        little one was blocked by his grandfather from behind. Surprised by the teasing, the 
        girl even spontaneously scolded him in a very spoiled tone 
        Apparently, Nur Shazwani Damia’s father at the time wore the mask of the famous animated 
        character ‘Shrek’ which may have been considered scary. After the video went viral, the girl 
        also shared a video of the little one's 'explanation' which is easier to be called Nana.
        In a very cute tone, his nephew admitted to being shocked when he was greeted by his grandfather.</p>

            <p>Unfolding chain of events in late April and May – mainly protests against Israeli plans
            to ethnically cleanse the Palestinian neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah in Jerusalem, days 
            of violent Israeli raids and hundreds of injuries at the Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound during
            Ramadan, and a bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip – the fourth in 13 years – Palestinians 
            inside Israel mobilised, leaving the state with multiple open fronts.
            By May 10, thousands emerged in at least 20 Palestinian towns in the 1948-areas, including
            smaller, lesser-known villages, in protests and confrontations described as “unprecedented.”<br>

           <p> Some people in Italy decided to turn their balcony into a stage and the result was purely 
            magical. Hundreds of residents in isolation took to their balconies to perform a popular Italian Ballad
            in the streets of Sienna, while people in Naples performed Abbracciame. A total
            of 3-4 such performances went viral . As a commenter wrote under this video, this pandemic has truly brought out the best 
            and worst in humanity.</p>
