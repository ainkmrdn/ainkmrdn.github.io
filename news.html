            <p style= "background-color:linen">
                In October 2020, an Israeli court ruled that several Palestinian families living in Sheikh Jarrah—a neighborhood in 
                East Jerusalem— <strong>were to be evicted by May 2021 with their land handed over to Jewish families.</strong> 
                In February 2021, several Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah filed an appeal to the court ruling and prompted 
                protests around the appeal hearings, the ongoing legal battle around property ownership, and demanding an end to the 
                forcible displacement of Palestinians from their homes in Jerusalem. In late April 2021, Palestinians began demonstrating
                in the streets of Jerusalem to protest the pending evictions and residents of Sheikh Jarrah—along with other activists—
                began to host nightly sit-ins. In early May, after a court ruled in favor of the evictions, the protests expanded with 
                Israeli police deploying force against demonstrators. 
                <br> 
                <br>
                On May 7, following weeks of daily demonstrations and rising tensions between protesters, Israeli settlers, and police 
                <strong>during the month of Ramadan, violence broke out at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, with Israeli police 
                using stun grenades, rubber bullets, and water cannons in a clash with protestors that left hundreds of Palestinians 
                wounded</strong>. After the clashes in Jerusalem’s Old City, tensions increased throughout East Jerusalem, compounded by 
                the celebration of Jerusalem Day. On May 10, after several consecutive days of violence throughout Jerusalem and the use 
                of lethal and nonlethal force by Israeli police, Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza, and other Palestinian militant
                groups launched hundreds of rockets into Israeli territory. Israel responded with air strikes and later artillery bombardments 
                against targets in Gaza, including launching several air strikes that killed more than twenty Palestinians. While claiming 
                to target Hamas, other militants, and their infrastructure—including tunnels and rocket launchers— <strong>Israel expanded
                its aerial campaign and struck targets including residential buildings, media headquarters, and refugee and healthcare 
                facilities.</strong>

            <center><img src="Images/ClimateChangePhoto.jpg" alt="No image" width="1000" height="500"></center>
             <p style= "background-color:linen">
                The IPCC experts project that in the coming decades <strong>climate changes will increase in all regions</strong>. For 
                1.5°C of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons. At 2°C of 
                global warming, heat extremes are more likely to reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health. But it 
                won’t be just about temperature. For example, <strong>climate change is intensifying the natural production of water – the water
                cycle</strong>. This brings more intense rainfall and associated flooding, as well as more intense drought in many regions. It is 
                also affecting rainfall patterns. In high latitudes, precipitation is likely to increase, while it is projected to 
                decrease over large parts of the subtropics.
            <br>
            <br> 
                Changes to monsoon rain patterns are expected, which will vary by region, the report warns.
                Moreover, coastal areas will see <strong>continued sea level rise throughout the 21st century</strong>, 
                contributing to more <strong>frequent and severe coastal flooding in low-lying areas and coastal erosion</strong> .Extreme sea 
                level events that previously occurred once in 100 years could happen every year by the end of this century.The report also
                indicates that further warming will amplify permafrost thawing, and the loss of seasonal snow cover, melting of glaciers 
                and ice sheets, and loss of summer Arctic sea ice. Changes to the ocean, including warming, more frequent marine heatwaves, 
                ocean acidification, and reduced oxygen levels, affect both ocean ecosystems and the people that rely on them, and they 
                will continue throughout at least the rest of this century.

                The Taliban claimed <strong> total control over Afghanistan</strong>, saying they had won the key battle for the Panjshir Valley, the last 
                remaining holdout of resistance against their rule. Following their lightning-fast victory in mid-August over the former
                Afghan government's security forces and the withdrawal of US troops <strong>after 20 years of war</strong>, the Taliban turned to fighting
                the forces defending the mountainous Panjshir Valley. 
            <br>
            <br>   
                As the Islamist hardliners claimed victory, their chief spokesman 
                warned against any further attempts to rise up against their rule while urging former members of the security forces to 
                join their regime's ranks. <strong>"With this victory, our country is completely taken out of the quagmire of war,"</strong> chief 
                spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. Anyone who tries to start an insurgency will be hit hard.

            <center><img src="Images/FacebookShutdown.jpg" alt="No image" width="1000" height="500"></center>
             <p style= "background-color:linen">
                The massive outage that took down Facebook, its associated services (Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Messenger), its 
                platform for businesses, and the company’s own internal network all started with <strong>routine maintenance</strong>.
                According to infrastructure vice president Santosh Janardhan, <strong>a command issued during maintenance</strong> inadvertently caused a 
                <strong>shutdown of the backbone that connects all of Facebook’s data centers, everywhere in the world.</strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
                That by itself is bad enough, but as we’ve already explained, the reason you couldn’t use Facebook is that <strong>the DNS and
                BGP routing information pointing to its servers suddenly disappeared</strong> . According to Janardhan, that problem was a 
                secondary issue, as Facebook’s DNS servers noted the loss of connection to the backbone and stopped advertising the BGP
                routing information that helps every computer on the internet find its servers. The DNS servers were still working, but 
                they were unreachable.
